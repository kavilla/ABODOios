# ABODOios

## Important: when you download this please run "pod install" from the terminal for dependencies.

Coding test for ABODO. I saw the email after leaving my office where I leave my windows computer which has my android studios. I don't have a lot memory on my mac which would be a little bit annoying to make room for android studios, so I decided that I would do the programming test in Swift. I knew it wouldn't be too bad and it was fun to do some iOS development while watching Star Wars. I can still do the android version tomorrow after my classes and meeting with my CS577 partner.

## Real-world example:
1. Makes an request to fetch data using the example end-point
2. Loads images
3. Displays rental information - bed range, price range, property name
4. Scrolls smoothly
5. Fits correctly on multiple sized screens - however while playing around with your app I noticed that you prevent the user from using the app in landscape mode so I locked that as well.
